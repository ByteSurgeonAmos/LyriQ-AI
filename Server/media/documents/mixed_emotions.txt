Verse 1
Started from the bottom, feeling lost and alone
Darkness all around me, heart as cold as stone
But then I saw a glimmer, a light breaking through
Found my inner strength now, ready to start anew

Chorus
Up and down this roller coaster life
Joy and pain, cutting like a knife
Some days I'm soaring, touching the sky
Other days I'm hurting, just want to cry

Verse 2
Got my squad behind me, they help me stand tall
Love the sunny moments, but sometimes I fall
Learning from my struggles, growing every day
Mixed emotions flowing, that's just my way

Bridge
Happy times give me wings to fly
Sad times teach me how to try
Angry moments make me strong
Peaceful days help me carry on

Outro
Life's a mix of colors, not just black and white
Through the storms and sunshine, I'll keep up the fight
